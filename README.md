## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `abbrev` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:abbrev, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Don't forget to run `mix deps.get` afterwards.

## Usage

## Contributing

  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`.

Pull requests are welcome. Pull requests with specs covering the changes
are especially welcome. Pull requests with specs, which have been run through
`mix format`, and pass `mix credo` are extra-especially welcome. :smile:
